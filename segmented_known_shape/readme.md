### This file contains 100 known shapes

1. 'Segmented_known_shape_coordinate' file contains segmented coordinate for each 100 shape. For example there are two part for writing 'A'. For that, the coordinates has two distinct path 

2. 'known_shape_ploting_image' file contains those 100 pyplot image

3. 'Image_known_shape' file contains the command of how to read those segmented coordinate from txt file, then convert into arrays and plot

4. 'data_segmentation' file is need for segmenting a shape. But here the 100 shapes are already segmented. So this code is not need for those particular 100 shapes.
